\title{A Graphical Interface to Perform STOCSY analyses on NMR Data}
\usage{
iSTATS()
}
\description{
Statistical TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (STOCSY) is a method developed to analyze 1D Nuclear
             Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data, with many applications in metabolomic science, as to help the
             identification of molecules in complex mixture. Although STOCSY is promising method, its use
             requires some programming language skills. To overcome this challenge we developed the interactive
             STATistical Spectroscopy (iSTATS) package, based on 'shiny', in which it is possible to perform STOCSY
             analyses in a full interactive way, from 1D NMR matrix construction to select specifical
             regions to apply STOCSY methods more accurately.
